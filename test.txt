Rent and Payment Schedule: The monthly rent amount, including what utilities (e.g., electricity, water, internet, meals) are included, the exact due date for rent payment (e.g., 5th of each month), acceptable payment methods (e.g., bank transfer, UPI, cash), and penalties for late payment should be clearly outlined.
Security Deposit: The amount of the security deposit, which is often one to two months' rent, will be specified. The agreement should also clarify the conditions under which the deposit will be refunded (in full or partially) at the end of the tenancy, as well as allowable deductions (e.g., for damages, unpaid bills). Obtaining a written receipt for the deposit is important.
Lease Duration and Termination: The agreement will specify the length of the stay (e.g., fixed-term or month-to-month). It should also define the notice period required by both the tenant and the landlord for terminating the agreement (typically 15 to 30 days) and any potential penalties for early termination or failure to provide proper notice.
Maintenance and Repairs: This section will detail who is responsible for routine maintenance (e.g., plumbing, electrical) and major repairs. It's common for tenants to be responsible for reporting damage promptly, and for the landlord to be responsible for repairs and ensuring the property is habitable.
Cleanliness and Hygiene: Tenants are generally responsible for maintaining the cleanliness of their assigned space and contributing to the upkeep of common areas like kitchens and bathrooms. The agreement should specify whether housekeeping services are included or if cleaning is a shared responsibility among tenants.
Visitor Policy: The rules regarding visitors, including whether overnight stays are permitted, restrictions on guests (e.g., gender, specific visiting hours), and any penalties for violations will be outlined.
Curfew Hours: Many PGs have specific curfew hours when residents are expected to return to the premises for safety and security reasons.
Prohibited Activities: The agreement will likely list activities that are strictly prohibited within the PG premises, such as smoking, drinking, gambling, or using illegal substances. Violations can lead to penalties or even eviction.
Conduct and Noise Levels: Tenants are expected to behave respectfully and maintain reasonable noise levels, especially during designated quiet hours (e.g., 10 PM to 7 AM). Respecting the privacy of other residents is also a key expectation.
Property Damage and Liability: Tenants are typically held responsible for any damage they cause to the property or its furnishings beyond normal wear and tear. The cost of repairs may be deducted from the security deposit.
